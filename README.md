_**Domain model and Data Model**_

this is the very simple example of applying data model to show how it works.
I ignore some best practice of coding for simplicity.
for see how it works just run tests.for see what data inserted in database, run tests in debug mode and run SQL query with "With(nolock)" before test execution completed.(after the test execution is completed ,the transaction will be rolled back)
